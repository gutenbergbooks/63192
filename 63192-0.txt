The Fairy and The Witch.


  (_Scene: A clearing in the forest, with Witch’s kettle suspended on
  tripod near the Right Front of Stage. No scenery is necessary but an
  added effectiveness can be secured if play is given out of doors._)

  (_Enter White Fairy from back of stage, to accompaniment of light,
  lilting music if desired. White Fairy in pantomime casts spell over
  region by tripping lightly to right of stage and waving wand, thence
  over kettle, thence to front, thence to left. Exit White Fairy at
  rear, music ceases._)

  (_Enter Black Witch from left, plods toward kettle chuckling
  fiendishly. Bends over kettle, presumably examining it, then moves
  towards left across front of stage during reading of lines._)

_Black Witch_ (_boastfully_) Mistress of this black night am I. Witch
and wizard of all the powers of night and darkness I am. Supreme
above all good in the Spirit World, tonight on mundane earth. I come
to work my spell and my skill in arts malign display. Not all the
holy saints, who tomorrow rule the day, can wrest from me my power of
night--Hallowe’en! (_in derision_) A hallowed evening! Oh, ho, ho! Ah,
ha, ha!! From that proud eminence brought low by me and now decreed to
devilish deeds and dark! Thus shall it ever be. (_Calling toward left,
off stage._) Come now my hosts of somber reputation. Make merry! With
fell design make we night hideous. Come Owl and hoot for me! (_Listens,
no response, calls louder._) Come Owl! Hoot Owl! (_Owl hoots off stage,
left. Aside, chuckling._) Didst hear the old fool hoot? (_Calling owl_)
Come nearer Owl, perch thou upon my shoulder. (_Owl hoots again very
faintly. Pleading_) Come Owl, Owl come! (_No response. Grows slightly
alarmed. Muses_) What portends this? Am I now to lose my power as Jove
hath so long menaced? Owl has fled and will not come to me. (_Pauses,
resumes hopefully_) Ah, well, in my train come others who will heed and
answer me. This night Black Witch must have her way!

  (_During next lines while calling upon her hosts the Witch moves to
  and fro calling toward different sections of the region as taste may
  dictate except as indicated with the lines._)

_Black Witch_ Black Cat, most common beast of evil augury, what sayest
thou? Come forth Black Cat. Let thy penetrating howl echo through the
wood. Roost thou upon my back. Come Black Cat, oh! Black Cat come!
(_Pauses, looks expectantly toward tree, no response. Then muses a
trifle sadly._) Ah! ’tis indeed a night of evil omen when my own Black
Cat forsaketh me. (_Turning hopefully_) Raven! Thou bird of sable
plumage, bleak and drear, hear thy mistress call. Sound thy raucous
note athwart the evening air. Come Raven! bear me company. (_Pauses,
no response. Despairingly_) Raven too is gone and will not heed my
voice. (_Brightening_) Oh! well, not yet do we despair, with ill intent
and fury unabated call we yet others! (_From front center of stage
directly facing audience._) Come snake! sleek-bellied serpent, curse
of women, cursed by men, come forth my own beloved. (_Drags point of
cane, wiggling, along ground from stage front towards self._) Start
from thy hole, oh! snake of mine. Let thy rattling hisses be heard
among the leaves. Coil clammily around me! (_Pauses, no response,
resumes furiously_) Seven curses be upon thee, pampered pet of Eve,
and thou wilt not come! (_Turns away in despair and next calls with
rather hopeless air._) Jackal, night prowler of the forest, hast thou
joined this motley crew of renegades? (_Pleadingly_) Heed my voice, oh!
Jackal! Prithee leave thy secret lair; come forth! Strike thy eerie
call weird and dominant! Soft-footed creep through the forest aisles
reposing at my feet. (_Pauses, no response, resumes furiously._) Keep
to thy den accursed beast forever! Rot and die!

_Black Witch_ (_Musing sadly_) Even yet, methinks, I must rely upon my
frisky imps of darkness to aid in this foul festival! (_Again brightens
hopefully, exclaims_) But no! But no!

  (_At this line Black Witch should be near front of stage at point
  directly in front of place where Mirth will enter. During next lines
  Black Witch raises arms aloft in supplication and backs toward place
  of Mirth’s entrance._)

_Black Witch_ (_Moving backwards, hands aloft in earnest
supplication._) Come, Wind of night! oh, Night Wind come! Thy blasting
fury loose upon this world! (_Pauses, drops arms, no response, again
muses sadly._) Ah! Wind of Night, on which I’ve drifted through the sky
these thousand years, hast thou too deserted me? (_Again raises arms
aloft and cries in desperation_) Will none come forth to do my will?

  (_Enter Mirth, silently, directly behind Black Witch. Remains behind
  B. W. and out of her sight, dogging her footsteps, poking fun at her,
  making grimaces, etc._)

_Black Witch_ (_Moving towards kettle soliloquizing brokenly_) Ah,
mighty Jove, hast thou delivered me unto mine enemies on this dark
night of all dark nights?--Some one has cast a spell upon the place and
for the moment I am powerless--Aye! for the moment! (_looks at her rod
as if conscious of it for the first time_) But I have still my trusty
rod of black, and it will yet dispel this impotence oppressive--Though
my voice fail this rod will fail me not!

  (_Makes passes over kettle with rod and turning slightly catches
  sight of Mirth._)

_Black Witch_ (_Rather amused as if White Fairy were a foe of small
consequence._) Ah, ha! White Fairy is now revealed as Jove’s agent
to work my ruin and she hath sent Mirth, her messenger, to haunt my
footsteps and bedevil me! (_chuckles, then calls_) Come Erebus, Imp of
Blackness, come! Make haste and drive this Mirth away.

  (_Erebus groans, off stage, left_)

  (_Enter Erebus from left, treading slowly and heavily_)

_Black Witch_ What ails thee, Imp of Blackness?

_Erebus_ (_Yawning_) I sleep and cannot wake. My feet drag like lead
behind me. (_groans_) My eyes will not open and my body wilts in sleep.

_Black Witch_ (_Musing_) It is the dread fairy spell! (_severely to
Erebus_) Cease thy deep grumblings and drive Mirth away from here.

  (_Erebus takes after Mirth. Mirth tripping lightly, Erebus dragging
  himself along heavily._)

  (_Exeunt Erebus and Mirth to back of stage._)

_Black Witch_ (_Calling, toward left_) Come also Noctis, Black Fury of
the night, come too! Speed thee hence. Lend thy brother aid.

  (_Enter Noctis, moaning and yawning, also treading heavily as if in a
  stupor._)

_Noctis_ (_Lifelessly_) Did call me, mother Witch?

_Black Witch_ (_Sharply_) I did, and art thou also sodden with a heavy
stupor?

_Noctis_ (_Trembling_) I am, dread mother Witch. My eyes refuse to open
and my feet will not obey my will.

_Black Witch_ (_Impatiently_) Cease thy grumblings and be thankful that
you live.

  (_Enter Erebus from back moving with crestfallen air towards witch._)

_Black Witch_ Even now methinks almighty Jove hath delivered this
region to White Fairy and our course is run. (_turns to Erebus_) Did
Mirth escape thee? (_Erebus bows head_) Sodden Imp! (_to both_) But
come, let us brew our witch’s brew. Gather around and with mighty magic
incantation will we boil a brew to blight the world.

  (_Enter Mirth and Jollity from back as Black Witch, Erebus and Noctis
  move toward kettle. Mirth and Jollity dog footsteps of the three,
  remaining out of sight poking fun at Witch, etc. Black Witch, Erebus
  and Noctis begin to spread out around kettle while Black Witch makes
  few passes with wand. She catches sight of Mirth and Jollity and
  screeches._)

_Black Witch_ (_Screeching_) Erebus and Noctis! fly after these unholy
imps of light!

  (_Erebus and Noctis pursue Mirth and Jollity, the fairy messengers
  tripping lightly, Erebus and Noctis following heavily. Exeunt, the
  four, to back of stage._)

_Black Witch_ (_following a few steps_) Fly, fly! Let not your
footsteps laggard be. Capture them and, returning hence, let their
bones and flesh serve but to fill the pot. (_Turns toward kettle,
chuckling with glee._) Oh, ho, ho! Ah, ha, ha! Two fairy messengers
to grace the witch’s brew. Fine will be the scent as their bones are
burned and flesh is boiled into the stew! (_Turning_) Erebus and
Noctis, fail me not!

  (_Enter Erebus and Noctis returning from chase empty handed, from
  back of stage._)

_Black Witch_ Didst let them escape thee, dull imps?

_Erebus and Noctis_ (_heads hanging_) Aye, dread mother.

_Black Witch_ (_Beating Erebus and Noctis about shoulders with rod_)
Stupid dullards! Worthless laggards! See that ye fail me not again!
(_Indignant_) Come with me and gather ’round the cauldron.

  (_They move over to kettle and take positions around it. Black Witch
  makes passes with rod and at signal from Black Witch all three chant
  chorus of incantation song. The solo stanzas of this song, also the
  chorus are to be droned out in a slow, sing-song chant, no particular
  tune or melody desired. Make it as weirdly unmusical and inharmonious
  as possible, but let the words “get across” distinctly._)

_Chorus_ (_Black Witch, Erebus and Noctis, while moving around the
kettle circling slowly._)

  We’re watching the pot and it’s going to boil;
  The air will get hot and this region will spoil,
  But that matters not for we brew witches’ oil.

  (_Stop circling. Black Witch waves rod. She reaches over and fingers
  the head of Erebus, tosses hand toward cauldron. Repeats process with
  Noctis. The three immediately resume circling around kettle while
  Black Witch sings first stanza in solo._)

_Black Witch_ (_solo chant_)

  1 A louse and a lizard
    And two babies fair;
    The brains of a pole-cat,
    Some coyote’s hair;
    Animals, reptiles
    And birds of the air,
    We take of their entrails
    And stir them with care.

_Chorus_ (_the three, still circling_)

  We’re watching the pot and it’s going to boil,
  The air will get hot and this region will spoil,
  But that matters not for we brew witches’ oil.

  (_All cease circling at conclusion of this chorus. Black Witch to be
  behind kettle facing audience. Erebus and Noctis on each side. While
  Black Witch sings next stanza the three sway back and forth but do
  not circle around._)

_Black Witch_ (_solo chants_)

  2 To those must be added
    The element, strife;
    Some envy and malice--
    The ills of our life--
    Vengeance and jealousy,
    Backbiting, lies,
    All put in the kettle
    With things we despise!

  (_The three immediately begin circling again and chant chorus._)

_All_ We’re watching the pot and it’s going to boil,
      The air will get hot and this region----

_Black Witch_ (_Interrupting hysterically and shaking rod menacingly
towards Erebus and Noctis in turn._) Curses upon thee, torpid imps!
Canst not chant with thy wonted vim? Let thy voices swell to the far
gods, else will sovereign Jove hear us not. Raise thy voices. I command
thee!

  (_The three resume circling and re-commence the chorus, Erebus and
  Noctis chanting louder._)

  _All_ We’re watching the pot and it’s going to boil,
        The air will get hot and this region will spoil,
        But that matters not for we----

_Black Witch_ (_Interrupting by beating the kettle with rod and
screaming furiously_) Curses upon thee, dead! black! pot!!

  (_Enter White Fairy at back of stage at word “pot”. Fairy raises
  wand. Light appears inside of kettle as Black Witch beats it, to be
  so timed that the glow appears at instant White Fairy raises wand._)

_Black Witch_ (_screaming triumphantly_) Ha! ha! it comes! Light
comes--light make fire--come fire--fire come!

_White Fairy_ (_coming forward and interrupting_) Stop! I command thee,
stop!

  (_Erebus and Noctis shiver, moan and fall prone on the ground,
  remaining there until told to fly by Black Witch._)

_Fairy_ (_From position a trifle to the left and back of kettle, gazing
steadily at Witch, ignoring imps._) This night thou art delivered unto
me.

_Black Witch_ (_moving toward Fairy_) Not so, not so, loathed Fairy.
Though ages old I still am young and thou shalt not prevail.

_Fairy_ (_calmly_) Thy power is gone----

_Black Witch_ (_Interrupting in derision_) Not yet, dear Fairy!
(_continues with air of triumph_) See yonder glow in my black pot? With
my rod I brought it and it will burn and brighten until thee and thine
consumed and parched be, and the whole world blighted. This rod, my
power, though it weakened be, is potent still and thou canst do naught
against me----

_Fairy_ (_Interrupting with cool hauteur_) That light is mine. I caused
it there. Forever it will glow--a fairy gleam to light and bless the
world. Thy power is gone, thy rod is dead.

  (_Black Witch begins to laugh scornfully, moves over and gazes into
  pot, is startled and laugh is choked down._)

_Black Witch_ (_murmuring hopelessly_) ’Tis true. ’Tis true.

  (_Black Witch grows afraid, moves away from kettle towards left
  across front of stage, muttering. Fairy maintains her original
  position but turns around slowly following movements of Black Witch
  with her eye. Fairy makes passes with wand toward Black Witch. Black
  Witch trembles and becomes furiously enraged._)

_Black Witch_ (_hysterically_) Begone, foul fairy, ere I smite thee
dead!

_Fairy_ (_Calmly_) Do thy worst. Thy worst is less than none.

  (_Black Witch grows desperate, approaches White Fairy and raises rod
  to strike her. At this moment B. W. should be to left of Fairy._)

_Black Witch_ With mine omnipotent rod I kill thee!

  (_Fairy smiles, holds forth her wand. Arms of Black Witch become
  rigid in mid-air._)

_Black Witch_ (_screaming_) Fly Erebus and Noctis, Imps of Blackness,
for your lives make haste! Away! Away!

  (_Exeunt Erebus and Noctis to back passing to the right and behind
  Witch and Fairy._)

_White Fairy_ (_still smiling_) Break rod, rod break!

  (_Touches rod with wand, rod breaks._)

_White Fairy_ (_slightly toward audience_) And thus shall broken be her
power forevermore.

  (_White Fairy waves her wand toward Black Witch, Black Witch
  trembles, groans, broken piece of rod falls from her hand._)

_Black Witch_ (_muttering_) ’Tis true. ’Tis true. Jove hath forsaken
me and aids this young sprite to do me harm---- (_words trail off into
silence as White Fairy continues to wave wand_.)

_White Fairy_ (_Low and rather sadly_) Thy lips are silent now forever.
Now thou must sleep--sleep witch, no longer witch.

  (_White Fairy continues to wave wand slowly. Black Witch nods head
  drowsily, wilts into sleep and falls to ground._)

_White Fairy_ Thou hast fallen. A deeper sleep is thine than fell upon
the Imps of Blackness. Sleep forever--wake no more!

  (_Black Witch exhales one last breath. Dies._)

_White Fairy_ (_solemnly_) Thine is a sleep eternal. Thou art dead.

  (_White Fairy gives one last pitiful look at dead Witch, then turns
  away smiling._)

_White Fairy_ (_calling_) Come Mirth and Jollity! Come, children, come.

  (_Mirth and Jollity and children, come tripping in with exclamations
  of childish delight, etc., until they spy the dead Witch; then their
  cries are hushed, their tripping ceases and they move furtively on
  tip-toe over to White Fairy glancing at her for explanations._)

_White Fairy_ Black Witch is dead. Her power is gone, and Hallowe’en
shall always be a hallowed evening--holy night! redeemed from evil by
the power of light. Let men rejoice and women sing. Let children play
and dance. This night, henceforth, is sacred to the joys of children.

  (_Children clap hands in applause._)

_White Fairy_ Come! let us dance.

  (_Music starts up. Any lively dance song for children such as can be
  found in any school music book will be suitable here. All clasp hands
  and begin to circle around kettle, singing and dancing. Music breaks
  off and all stop singing abruptly in middle of first stanza. Children
  all glance towards dead Witch then towards Fairy._)

_White Fairy_ What is it, children?

_Mirth_ Good Fairy, we want no one to die.

_White Fairy_ (_touching Mirth with wand_) Bless you, dear messenger of
mine, but the witch is evil and cannot live.

_Jollity_ Can’t you give the witch her life but keep her evil power
away from her?

_Children_ (_in unison_) Please good Fairy, restore the Witch’s life!
Please oh! please.

_White Fairy_ (_pondering_) Your pleas move me. I will restore the
witch’s life. In Spirit world she can no longer live. A mortal, she
must dwell upon the earth.

  (_Children cluster in “background” as Fairy goes toward Witch._)

_White Fairy_ (_touching Witch with wand_) Insensate clay awake! Moved
by the tears of children, whom thou hast terrified and wronged, I give
thee life. Thou canst no longer dwell with spirits. Wake in mortal form!

  (_Witch begins to show signs of life as White Fairy continues to wave
  wand._)

_White Fairy_ (_Resuming_) Too long hast thou disgraced thy sex in
Spirit World, in mortal life thou shalt assume the guise of man.

  (_During preceding lines Witch must unfasten necessary strings,
  hooks, etc., to allow entire costume to fall off as she rises. Fairy
  reads next line upon receiving signal from Witch that all is ready._)

_White Fairy_ (_stepping back and raising wand_) Rise mortal man.

  (_Mortal rises, children cheer._)

_White Fairy_ (_Continuing_) Be grateful for thy life.

  Note--If part of Witch is played by female omit this line and change
  words to feminine gender in following lines where necessary. In the
  original production the Witch was effectively impersonated by a young
  man thus bringing out a stronger anti-climax upon restoration to life.

_Mortal_ (_bowing_) I am grateful.

  (_Fairy disposes of wand by hanging it on her dress._)

_White Fairy_ Thy life is due these children. See thou be good to them
else will thy life be forfeited to me again. Love them, I command thee.

_Mortal_ (_bowing low and gently kissing Fairy’s hand_) I will love
them and obey thee, most gracious majesty.

  (_White Fairy and Mortal clasp hands and turn toward audience._)

_White Fairy_ Thus ever shall the powers of night and darkness be
dispelled.

_Mortal_ And good will triumph over evil everywhere.

  (_They bow to audience and to each other._)

_White Fairy_ Will dance with us, my Lord?

_Mortal_ Your majesty doth honor me.

  (_All join hands circling around kettle and sing dance song. Organ
  glides into march at end. All march off, Fairy and Mortal in lead,
  then Mirth and Jollity, followed by children. Exunt all._)


CURTAIN.




TWO PLAYS FOR BOYS

By SEYMOUR S. TIBBALS.


Mr. Tibbals has been unusually successful in furnishing boys’ plays
that introduce characters true to life. While the plays are strong and
forceful in the lessons they teach, clean comedy predominates and the
boys like them.


“The Millionaire Janitor”

A comedy in two acts. Here is a rollicking play for eight or more boys
with plenty of action. Just the thing for a Boys’ Class or Junior
Y.M.C.A. Easily staged and costumed. Opportunity for introduction of
musical numbers and recitations. By introducing such features the play
may be used for an entire evening’s entertainment.

  Price 25 Cents


“Up Caesar’s Creek”

A splendid play for any number of boys. The characters are real boys
and the play deals with their experiences while camping up Caesar’s
Creek the performance closing with a minstrel show in camp. Costumes
and scenery are not elaborate and the play may be produced on any stage.

  Price 25 Cents

These comedies are protected by copyright, but permission for amateur
production is granted with the purchase of the book.
