<div class="blockquot2">
<p>(<i>Scene: A clearing in the forest, with Witch&#8217;s
kettle suspended on tripod near the Right
Front of Stage. No scenery is necessary but
an added effectiveness can be secured if play
is given out of doors.</i>)</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Enter White Fairy from back of stage, to accompaniment
of light, lilting music if desired. White
Fairy in pantomime casts spell over region by tripping
lightly to right of stage and waving wand, thence over
kettle, thence to front, thence to left. Exit White
Fairy at rear, music ceases.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Black Witch from left, plods toward kettle
chuckling fiendishly. Bends over kettle, presumably
examining it, then moves towards left across front of
stage during reading of lines.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>boastfully</i>) Mistress of this black
night am I. Witch and wizard of all the powers of
night and darkness I am. Supreme above all good in
the Spirit World, tonight on mundane earth. I come
to work my spell and my skill in arts malign display.
Not all the holy saints, who tomorrow rule the day,
can wrest from me my power of night&mdash;Hallowe&#8217;en!
(<i>in derision</i>) A hallowed evening! Oh, ho, ho! Ah,
ha, ha!! From that proud eminence brought low by
me and now decreed to devilish deeds and dark!
Thus shall it ever be. (<i>Calling toward left, off stage.</i>)
Come now my hosts of somber reputation. Make
merry! With fell design make we night hideous.
Come Owl and hoot for me! (<i>Listens, no response,
calls louder.</i>) Come Owl! Hoot Owl! (<i>Owl hoots off
stage, left. Aside, chuckling.</i>) Didst hear the old
fool hoot? (<i>Calling owl</i>) Come nearer Owl, perch
thou upon my shoulder. (<i>Owl hoots again very faintly.
Pleading</i>) Come Owl, Owl come! (<i>No response.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Grows slightly alarmed. Muses</i>) What portends this?
Am I now to lose my power as Jove hath so long menaced?
Owl has fled and will not come to me. (<i>Pauses,
resumes hopefully</i>) Ah, well, in my train come others
who will heed and answer me. This night Black
Witch must have her way!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>During next lines while calling upon her hosts the
Witch moves to and fro calling toward different sections
of the region as taste may dictate except as indicated
with the lines.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> Black Cat, most common beast of evil
augury, what sayest thou? Come forth Black Cat.
Let thy penetrating howl echo through the wood.
Roost thou upon my back. Come Black Cat, oh!
Black Cat come! (<i>Pauses, looks expectantly toward
tree, no response. Then muses a trifle sadly.</i>) Ah! &#8217;tis
indeed a night of evil omen when my own Black Cat
forsaketh me. (<i>Turning hopefully</i>) Raven! Thou
bird of sable plumage, bleak and drear, hear thy mistress
call. Sound thy raucous note athwart the
evening air. Come Raven! bear me company.
(<i>Pauses, no response. Despairingly</i>) Raven too is
gone and will not heed my voice. (<i>Brightening</i>) Oh!
well, not yet do we despair, with ill intent and fury
unabated call we yet others! (<i>From front center of
stage directly facing audience.</i>) Come snake! sleek-bellied
serpent, curse of women, cursed by men, come
forth my own beloved. (<i>Drags point of cane, wiggling,
along ground from stage front towards self.</i>) Start
from thy hole, oh! snake of mine. Let thy rattling
hisses be heard among the leaves. Coil clammily
around me! (<i>Pauses, no response, resumes furiously</i>)
Seven curses be upon thee, pampered pet of Eve, and
thou wilt not come! (<i>Turns away in despair and next
calls with rather hopeless air.</i>) Jackal, night prowler
of the forest, hast thou joined this motley crew of
renegades? (<i>Pleadingly</i>) Heed my voice, oh! Jackal!
Prithee leave thy secret lair; come forth! Strike thy
eerie call weird and dominant! Soft-footed creep
through the forest aisles reposing at my feet. (<i>Pauses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
no response, resumes furiously.</i>) Keep to thy den
accursed beast forever! Rot and die!</p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Musing sadly</i>) Even yet, methinks,
I must rely upon my frisky imps of darkness to aid
in this foul festival! (<i>Again brightens hopefully, exclaims</i>)
But no! But no!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>At this line Black Witch should be near front of
stage at point directly in front of place where Mirth
will enter. During next lines Black Witch raises
arms aloft in supplication and backs toward place of
Mirth&#8217;s entrance.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Moving backwards, hands aloft in
earnest supplication.</i>) Come, Wind of night! oh, Night
Wind come! Thy blasting fury loose upon this world!
(<i>Pauses, drops arms, no response, again muses sadly.</i>)
Ah! Wind of Night, on which I&#8217;ve drifted through the
sky these thousand years, hast thou too deserted me?
(<i>Again raises arms aloft and cries in desperation</i>)
Will none come forth to do my will?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Enter Mirth, silently, directly behind Black Witch.
Remains behind B. W. and out of her sight, dogging
her footsteps, poking fun at her, making grimaces, etc.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Moving towards kettle soliloquizing
brokenly</i>) Ah, mighty Jove, hast thou delivered me
unto mine enemies on this dark night of all dark
nights?&mdash;Some one has cast a spell upon the place
and for the moment I am powerless&mdash;Aye! for the
moment! (<i>looks at her rod as if conscious of it for the
first time</i>) But I have still my trusty rod of black,
and it will yet dispel this impotence oppressive&mdash;Though
my voice fail this rod will fail me not!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Makes passes over kettle with rod and turning
slightly catches sight of Mirth.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Rather amused as if White Fairy
were a foe of small consequence.</i>) Ah, ha! White Fairy
is now revealed as Jove&#8217;s agent to work my ruin and
she hath sent Mirth, her messenger, to haunt my
footsteps and bedevil me! (<i>chuckles, then calls</i>) Come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Erebus, Imp of Blackness, come! Make haste and
drive this Mirth away.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Erebus groans, off stage, left</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Erebus from left, treading slowly and heavily</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> What ails thee, Imp of Blackness?</p>

<p><i>Erebus</i> (<i>Yawning</i>) I sleep and cannot wake. My
feet drag like lead behind me. (<i>groans</i>) My eyes will
not open and my body wilts in sleep.</p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Musing</i>) It is the dread fairy spell!
(<i>severely to Erebus</i>) Cease thy deep grumblings and
drive Mirth away from here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Erebus takes after Mirth. Mirth tripping lightly,
Erebus dragging himself along heavily.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Exeunt Erebus and Mirth to back of stage.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Calling, toward left</i>) Come also
Noctis, Black Fury of the night, come too! Speed
thee hence. Lend thy brother aid.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Enter Noctis, moaning and yawning, also treading
heavily as if in a stupor.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Noctis</i> (<i>Lifelessly</i>) Did call me, mother Witch?</p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Sharply</i>) I did, and art thou also
sodden with a heavy stupor?</p>

<p><i>Noctis</i> (<i>Trembling</i>) I am, dread mother Witch.
My eyes refuse to open and my feet will not obey my
will.</p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Impatiently</i>) Cease thy grumblings
and be thankful that you live.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Enter Erebus from back moving with crestfallen
air towards witch.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> Even now methinks almighty Jove
hath delivered this region to White Fairy and our
course is run. (<i>turns to Erebus</i>) Did Mirth escape
thee? (<i>Erebus bows head</i>) Sodden Imp! (<i>to both</i>)
But come, let us brew our witch&#8217;s brew. Gather
around and with mighty magic incantation will we
boil a brew to blight the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Enter Mirth and Jollity from back as Black Witch,
Erebus and Noctis move toward kettle. Mirth and
Jollity dog footsteps of the three, remaining out of sight
poking fun at Witch, etc. Black Witch, Erebus and
Noctis begin to spread out around kettle while Black
Witch makes few passes with wand. She catches sight
of Mirth and Jollity and screeches.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Screeching</i>) Erebus and Noctis!
fly after these unholy imps of light!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Erebus and Noctis pursue Mirth and Jollity, the
fairy messengers tripping lightly, Erebus and Noctis
following heavily. Exeunt, the four, to back of stage.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>following a few steps</i>) Fly, fly!
Let not your footsteps laggard be. Capture them
and, returning hence, let their bones and flesh serve
but to fill the pot. (<i>Turns toward kettle, chuckling
with glee.</i>) Oh, ho, ho! Ah, ha, ha! Two fairy
messengers to grace the witch&#8217;s brew. Fine will be
the scent as their bones are burned and flesh is boiled
into the stew! (<i>Turning</i>) Erebus and Noctis, fail
me not!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Enter Erebus and Noctis returning from chase
empty handed, from back of stage.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> Didst let them escape thee, dull imps?</p>

<p><i>Erebus and Noctis</i> (<i>heads hanging</i>) Aye, dread
mother.</p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Beating Erebus and Noctis about
shoulders with rod</i>) Stupid dullards! Worthless
laggards! See that ye fail me not again! (<i>Indignant</i>)
Come with me and gather &#8217;round the cauldron.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>They move over to kettle and take positions around
it. Black Witch makes passes with rod and at signal
from Black Witch all three chant chorus of incantation
song. The solo stanzas of this song, also the chorus
are to be droned out in a slow, sing-song chant, no
particular tune or melody desired. Make it as weirdly
unmusical and inharmonious as possible, but let
the words &#8220;get across&#8221; distinctly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p></div>

moving around the kettle circling slowly.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Interrupting hysterically and shaking
rod menacingly towards Erebus and Noctis in turn.</i>)
Curses upon thee, torpid imps! Canst not chant with
thy wonted vim? Let thy voices swell to the far
gods, else will sovereign Jove hear us not. Raise thy
voices. I command thee!</p>

<p>(<i>The three resume circling and re-commence the
chorus, Erebus and Noctis chanting louder.</i>)</p></div>

<span class="indent2">The air will get hot and this region will spoil,</span><br />
<span class="indent2">But that matters not for we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Interrupting by beating the kettle
with rod and screaming furiously</i>) Curses upon thee,

<p>(<i>Enter White Fairy at back of stage at word &#8220;pot&#8221;.

Black Witch beats it, to be so timed that the glow appears

of kettle, gazing steadily at Witch, ignoring imps.</i>)
This night thou art delivered unto me.</p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>moving toward Fairy</i>) Not so, not
so, loathed Fairy. Though ages old I still am young
and thou shalt not prevail.</p>

<p><i>Fairy</i> (<i>calmly</i>) Thy power is gone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>Interrupting in derision</i>) Not yet,
dear Fairy! (<i>continues with air of triumph</i>) See
yonder glow in my black pot? With my rod I brought
it and it will burn and brighten until thee and thine
consumed and parched be, and the whole world
blighted. This rod, my power, though it weakened
be, is potent still and thou canst do naught against
me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fairy</i> (<i>Interrupting with cool hauteur</i>) That light
is mine. I caused it there. Forever it will glow&mdash;a
fairy gleam to light and bless the world. Thy power
is gone, thy rod is dead.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Black Witch begins to laugh scornfully, moves over
and gazes into pot, is startled and laugh is choked
down.</i>)</p></div>

&#8217;Tis true.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Black Witch grows afraid, moves away from kettle

maintains her original position but turns around slowly

<p><i>Black Witch</i> (<i>hysterically</i>) Begone, foul fairy, ere
I smite thee dead!</p>

<p><i>Fairy</i> (<i>Calmly</i>) Do thy worst. Thy worst is
less than none.</p>

<p>(<i>Black Witch grows desperate, approaches White
Fairy and raises rod to strike her. At this moment

Away!</p>

<p>(<i>Touches rod with wand, rod breaks.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>slightly toward audience</i>) And

Jove hath forsaken me and aids this young sprite to
do me harm&mdash;&mdash; (<i>words trail off into silence as White
Fairy continues to wave wand</i>.)</p>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>Low and rather sadly</i>) Thy lips
are silent now forever. Now thou must sleep&mdash;sleep
witch, no longer witch.</p>

<p>(<i>White Fairy continues to wave wand slowly. Black
Witch nods head drowsily, wilts into sleep and falls to
ground.</i>)</p></div>

thine than fell upon the Imps of Blackness. Sleep
forever&mdash;wake no more!</p>

Come, children, come.</p>

<p>(<i>Mirth and Jollity and children, come tripping in

tripping ceases and they move furtively on tip-toe over

<p><i>White Fairy</i> Black Witch is dead. Her power is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
gone, and Hallowe&#8217;en shall always be a hallowed
evening&mdash;holy night! redeemed from evil by the
power of light. Let men rejoice and women sing.
Let children play and dance. This night, henceforth,
is sacred to the joys of children.</p>

<p>(<i>Music starts up. Any lively dance song for children

Fairy.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> What is it, children?</p>

<p><i>Mirth</i> Good Fairy, we want no one to die.</p>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>touching Mirth with wand</i>) Bless
you, dear messenger of mine, but the witch is evil
and cannot live.</p>

<p><i>Jollity</i> Can&#8217;t you give the witch her life but keep
her evil power away from her?</p>

<p><i>Children</i> (<i>in unison</i>) Please good Fairy, restore
the Witch&#8217;s life! Please oh! please.</p>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>pondering</i>) Your pleas move me.
I will restore the witch&#8217;s life. In Spirit world she
can no longer live. A mortal, she must dwell upon
the earth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Children cluster in &#8220;background&#8221; as Fairy goes
toward Witch.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>touching Witch with wand</i>) Insensate
clay awake! Moved by the tears of children,
whom thou hast terrified and wronged, I give thee
life. Thou canst no longer dwell with spirits. Wake
in mortal form!</p>

<p>(<i>Witch begins to show signs of life as White Fairy
continues to wave wand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p></div>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>Resuming</i>) Too long hast thou disgraced
thy sex in Spirit World, in mortal life thou
shalt assume the guise of man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>During preceding lines Witch must unfasten necessary
strings, hooks, etc., to allow entire costume to fall
off as she rises. Fairy reads next line upon receiving
signal from Witch that all is ready.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>stepping back and raising wand</i>)
Rise mortal man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Mortal rises, children cheer.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> (<i>Continuing</i>) Be grateful for thy
life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Note&mdash;If part of Witch is played by female
omit this line and change words to feminine
gender in following lines where necessary.
In the original production the Witch was effectively
impersonated by a young man thus
bringing out a stronger anti-climax upon restoration
to life.</p></div>

<p><i>Mortal</i> (<i>bowing</i>) I am grateful.</p>

<p>(<i>Fairy disposes of wand by hanging it on her dress.</i>)</p></div>

<p><i>White Fairy</i> Thy life is due these children. See

hand</i>) I will love them and obey thee, most gracious
majesty.</p>

<p class="ph1">TWO PLAYS FOR BOYS</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">By SEYMOUR S. TIBBALS.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>Mr. Tibbals has been unusually successful in furnishing
boys&#8217; plays that introduce characters true to
life. While the plays are strong and forceful in the
lessons they teach, clean comedy predominates and
the boys like them.</p>


<p class="ph1">&#8220;The Millionaire Janitor&#8221;</p>

<p>A comedy in two acts. Here is a rollicking play
for eight or more boys with plenty of action. Just
the thing for a Boys&#8217; Class or Junior Y.M.C.A.
Easily staged and costumed. Opportunity for introduction
of musical numbers and recitations. By introducing
such features the play may be used for
an entire evening&#8217;s entertainment.</p>

<p class="ph2">Price 25 Cents</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p class="ph1">&#8220;Up Caesar&#8217;s Creek&#8221;</p>

<p>A splendid play for any number of boys. The
characters are real boys and the play deals with their
experiences while camping up Caesar&#8217;s Creek the performance
closing with a minstrel show in camp. Costumes
and scenery are not elaborate and the play may
be produced on any stage.</p>

<p class="ph2">Price 25 Cents</p>

<p>These comedies are protected by copyright, but
permission for amateur production is granted with
the purchase of the book.</p>
